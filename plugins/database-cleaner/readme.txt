Clean and optimize your database, for real! Lot of features, handle oversized databases, built on latest WP and PHP evolutions.

== Description ==

Clean your database for real, whatever its size is, while focusing on what can make it faster. An user-friendly UI will help you to make everything perfect. If there are too many issues to delete, it will use asynchronous requests to avoid timeouts. You will more information here: [Database Cleaner on Meow Apps](https://meowapps.com/database-cleaner/).

== Features ==

There are others database cleaners on the market, but since I felt like there were rather incomplete and old, based on my experiences with modern UIs and ways of coding plugins, I had to create this new one. Here are the current features:

- The **Auto Clean** Button. It will clean everything you set on Auto in Database Cleaner. That will make your life easier, once everything is set up.
- **Clean the Usual Items**: Revisions, drafts, trash, useless metas, useless comments, useless users, transients, etc. If I missed something, let me know: I can add support for new items right away.
- **Clean your Post Types**. List your post types, and help you getting rid of data in unimportant post types such as the ones used for temporary data such as logs. Those slow down your WordPress more than anything else!
- **Clean your Tables**. Display all your tables, their sizes, and help you getting rid of the useless ones.
- **Clean your Options**. Display all your options, their sizes, and help you getting rid of the useless ones. You can also set your options as being not autoloaded.
- **Clean your Cron Jobs**. Display all your jobs, their schedules, and help you getting rid of the useless ones.

***For Post Types, Tables, Options and Cron Jobs, Database Cleaner has its own references in order to tell you by which plugins or themes they are use. For full support of this, you will need the Pro Version.***

**IMPORTANT:** Please prepare a backup of your database before using this plugin! Better be safe than sorry :)

== Why this plugin? ==

There are other similar cleaners on the market. I used them, but I always felt they were imperfect, with old UI, somehow frozen in time. There were also missing Post Types support, but I could handle this manually. At the end of 2021, I had issues with my databases (which were too big) and all those plugins simply failed; this was the last straw: I started to develop a fresh and new database cleaner plugin, with a PHP 7 base, modern concepts, and build to actually speed-up WordPress. I am now resolved to make it work for everyone, adding all the features you absolutely need.  

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to WordPress.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Meow Apps -> Database Cleaner in the sidebar and check the appropriate options.
4. Click on the button to clean your database automatically.
